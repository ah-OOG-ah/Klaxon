# Klaxon
Adds klaxons, air-raid sirens, and other annoying blocks and items to Minecraft! Because we all needed that, right?

# Building

## IntelliJ
Open the repo folder as a project, and run

`gradlew genIntellijRuns`(Windows), or

`./gradlew genIntellijRuns`(Linux/MacOS)

in the terminal. Then, run

`gradlew build`(Windows), or

`./gradlew build`(Linux/MacOS)

The mod .jar will be in `<repo folder>/build/libs`

##Eclipse
I don't use it, so correct me if this doesn't work, but the steps should be the same, except you run `genEclipseRuns` instead of `genIntellijRuns`
